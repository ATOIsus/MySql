# 1) Examin the table you have created . You do this using

# desc<table_name> 



desc tbl_students;



# 2) View above created table using select query

# - To see all columns:

# Select * from table_name





Select * FROM tbl_students;





# 3) Select roll_no,fname,lname of student from above table

# To select desired columns:

# Select roll_no,fname,lname from tbl_students



 Select  roll_no,fname,lname from tbl_students;

 

 

 

 # 4) Find fname and age of student

 

SELECT fname,age FROM tbl_students;



# 5) Find the entry fee paid by every student along with their fname.



SELECT fname, entry_fee FROM tbl_students;



# 6) Show the fname and lname of student as full name in a single column



SELECT fname, lname, CONCAT(fname,' ', lname)  AS Full_Name FROM tbl_students;







# Exercise 2:



# 1) Count the total number of student in tbl_student

# Select count(roll_no) from tbl_student



SELECT count(roll_no) FROM tbl_students;





# 2) Find maximum age of student



SELECT max(age) FROM tbl_students;



# 3) Find minimum age of student



SELECT min(age) FROM tbl_students;



# 4) Find avg age of student



SELECT avg(age) FROM tbl_students;



# 5) Find the total entry fee paid students



SELECT sum(entry_fee) FROM tbl_students;
